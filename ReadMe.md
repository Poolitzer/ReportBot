This is a simple report bot. It mentions all admins in one message when someone writes @admin, /admin or /report in a group.

Admins are able to exclude themselves from being mentioned or instead receive a PM.

A working instance of the bot can be found at https://t.me/TheReportBot.

You need to fill out the tokens.py, and have a running mongodb instances in the background
